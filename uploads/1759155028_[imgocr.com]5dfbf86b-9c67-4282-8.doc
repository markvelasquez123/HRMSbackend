My name is Mark Jhondel G. Velasquez, 22 years old, and a graduate of Adamson University with a degree in Information Technology. I would like to apply to your company to further expand my knowledge and skills in the IT field. I am eager to learn and willing to listen, as I believe that continuous learning and openness to guidance are important in broadening my knowledge and improving my capabilities.



I am currently employed, with my last working day at the end of September. My current position is Web Developer, but at times I feel that the role does not fully match my interests. Recently, I was given the opportunity to handle networking and office support tasks for about two weeks, and I truly enjoyed the experience. Because of this, I would like to explore a different path, particularly in office support.



I am currently working at the company where I had my on-the-job training, and I was absorbed as an employee. I’ve been with them for about a month and a half now as an employee. However, I don’t really see myself growing as a Web Developer. I discovered that I enjoy more the tasks related to office support and networking, which I find more fulfilling.
